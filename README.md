# Project Title: OpenAI ChatCompletion Doctor with Web Scraping

## Description
The OpenAI ChatCompletion Doctor project aims to create a conversational chatbot using OpenAI's ChatCompletion API. The chatbot will be able to research information on Google by utilizing BeautifulSoup for web scraping. By providing a query parameter, the chatbot will fetch search results from Google and provide the user with relevant information. The project is written in Python and relies on the requests and bs4 libraries.

## Business Plan
The purpose of developing the OpenAI ChatCompletion Doctor is to offer users an interactive and intelligent assistant capable of providing researched information from the internet. This project can be utilized in various applications such as:

- Virtual Assistants: Integrating the chatbot with virtual assistants can enhance their capabilities to research and provide accurate information to users.
- Educational Platforms: The chatbot can serve as a learning resource by answering queries and providing researched information to students and educators.
- Customer Support: Incorporating the chatbot into customer support systems can help resolve customer queries by fetching relevant information from the web.

The project will be monetized through:

- Licensing: Offering commercial licenses to enterprises and organizations that wish to integrate the chatbot into their systems.
- API Access: Providing an API endpoint for developers to access the chatbot's capabilities for a subscription fee.
- Custom Development: Offering custom development and consulting services to tailor the chatbot's functionalities to specific business requirements.
